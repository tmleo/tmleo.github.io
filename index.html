        <h2>How I get the idea to become a web developer</h2>
        
        <p><a id="1-content">The idea of becoming a web developer comes from my young days. When I've got my first computer and alwayes liked to watch 'colorful' movies about hacking.
So being precise My first dream was about becoming a HACKER.             </a>

            I found HackYourFuture in the internet during looking for some onlie curses about programming. Then I saw that HackYourFuture is recruting new students to their school. So I didnt wait, I applied straight away.
After few weeks they repied and I got Test Assigment to do. And Here I am. I am doing one of the test exercices.
